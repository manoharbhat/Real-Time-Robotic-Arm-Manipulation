# Robotic-Arm-Manipulation-using-OpenCV
A 3 D printed Robotic arm controlled by 5 servo motors for each finger of the arm. As the user shows his hand gesture in front of the camera, OpenCV recognizes the gesture using contours and basic math to find out the number of fingers held up. Then OpenCV sends the information to Arduino Uno using serial communication. Arduino then sends commands to the servo motors and the respective fingers are shown e.g.1, 4, yo, peace signs and numbers.
Compents/Tools Required:
Arduino Uno,
webcam,
OpenCV-python,
5 servo motors,
connecting wires,
hand glove(optional)
